# CONXCLIP: A Novel Image Captioning Method

CONXCLIP is a novel image captioning method that leverages the capabilities of CLIP and GPT-2, incorporating feature enhancement techniques. This method introduces a **novel attention mechanism** designed to maintain coherence in long sequences, ensuring that context is preserved throughout the generated captions.

## Features:
- **CLIP Integration**: Utilizes CLIP for powerful visual feature extraction, linking images to textual representations.
- **GPT-2 Integration**: Leverages GPT-2 for natural language generation, enabling high-quality captioning.
- **Feature Enhancement Techniques**: Implements various techniques to improve the quality and relevance of generated captions.
- **Novel Attention Mechanism**: Introduces a custom attention mechanism to maintain coherence in long sequences and ensure contextual consistency throughout the captions.


#NOTE: All code blocks in diffrent py files will be soon included in more structred format
